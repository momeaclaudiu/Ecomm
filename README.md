# Ecomm
Ecomm is a basic web app which has some important elements of a real shopping website. 

In the application the user can add items in the cart as a guess(or as a user) which will automatically be moved in his own cart once he creates an username at http://localhost:3000/signup or signs in at http://localhost:3000/signin. Changes can be made in the cart as changing the number of items the user wants to buy or deleting items.
